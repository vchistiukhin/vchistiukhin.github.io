- title: Joining FreshOffice
  from: Sep 2013
  to: Jan. 2014
  description: My career in IT, I started as a Trainee QA engineer at FreshOffice. My growing interest and understanding of the product led me to become more involved in the processes of the project. <br><br>
               I wanted to understand everything about our project. How does it work? Why is this issue happening? How can this issue be fixed? Can I somehow help in solving it? I asked so many questions that one day, our CEO mentioned there was an opening for a Junior QA engineer, and I could join if I want to. And so, I decided to give it a try.

  from: Jan. 2014
  to: Dec. 2014
  description:  In January 2014, I joined FreshOffice QA team as a Junior QA Engineer. As a newcomer, I had a lot to learn about quality assurance, the development process, and IT overall. Luckily, our team of amazing engineers and product managers guided me through this transition period, enabling me to experience my first successes and failures.<br><br>
                At the beginning, I focused on learning the quality assurance practices, processes, and tools. Apart from that, I tried to contribute as much as possible to the project's quality, even as a newcomer. I found myself in a position between the development and support teams, helping both with information exchange, providing guidance to the support team.<br><br>

- title: Turning into an Engineer
  from: Jan. 2015
  to: Feb. 2016
  description: In 2015, after mastering the core quality assurance practices, I began working with the testing documentation. Combining my product knowledge and some existing practices, I successfully built test coverage for the crucial features. At the same time, I delved more deeply into software development as a process, working closely with the dev team. <br><br>
               During that year, I continued to develop my skill set. I actively engaged in the development process, contributed to feature planning. At this point, I was able to cover new functionalities with properly shaped testing documentation, test the new features, and fully participate as a team member.

               At the beginning of 2016, the company faced a financial crisis. As part of the solution, it was decided to focus on supporting existing functionality rather than development. With my greatest appreciation of all I've got at FreshOffice, I decided to move on to the next project - <a href="/projects/advisorengine" class="grey-link">AdvisorEngine</a>. <br><br>  
               What Iâ€™ve learned at FreshOffice:<br>
               - Mastering the quality assurance processes and tools is a long-term goal.<br>
               - Constant learning helps to overcome the fear of failure.<br>
               - Working with an experienced and kind team is priceless.<br>
               - Even great and successful projects sometimes face a crisis.<br>
