    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I’m a Software QA Engineer who’s passionate about making sure every product we release is the best it can be. I’ve worked on improving QA processes across a variety of projects and enjoy collaborating with my team to build reliable, high-quality applications. My experience covers testing backend systems, as well as iOS, Android, and web apps.</p>
    
    <p>I’m an active part of the team from day one, taking part in everything from planning to release.<br>
    Along the way, I draw on my language skills — English (C1), Serbo-Croatian (C1), and Spanish (A2) — to communicate and collaborate effectively across diverse teams and projects. My native language is Russian.</p>
