    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I’m a Senior QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience improving product quality across web, mobile and backend platforms. I work end-to-end - from refining requirements and designing test strategy to coordinating regressions and signing off releases.</p>
    
    <p>Over my career I’ve delivered QA for consumer apps (1M+ MAU) and complex B2B SaaS platforms, ensuring predictable, low-risk releases. I focus on preventing issues early, aligning testing with business goals, and giving teams the clarity and confidence they need to ship.</p>
    <p>I’m comfortable building QA processes from scratch, mentoring engineers, and integrating AI/LLM-based tools to speed up analysis, documentation and test design. I thrive in environments where quality matters, requirements evolve, and a reliable product is key to success.</p>
