<br>Greetings! My name is Vladimir, and I'm Your Fellow QA Engineer. <br>
<br>I’m a Senior QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience improving product quality across web, mobile and backend platforms. I work across the entire development lifecycle - from refining requirements and designing test strategy to coordinating regressions and signing off releases.<br>
<br>Over my career I’ve delivered QA for consumer apps (1.2M+ MAU), ensuring predictable, low-risk releases and maintaining zero high-severity production issues for 6+ months on a high-traffic product. I focus on preventing issues early, aligning testing with business goals, and giving teams the clarity and confidence they need to ship.<br>
<br> I’m comfortable building QA processes from scratch, mentoring engineers, and integrating AI/LLM-based tools to speed up analysis, documentation and test design. I thrive in environments where quality matters, requirements evolve, and a reliable product is key to success.<br>
<br>Based in Oviedo, Spain (remote global). Fluent in English, Serbo-Croatian, Russian.<br> Currently improving my Spanish (intermediate).
